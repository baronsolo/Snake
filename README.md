# Snake
Old school game

Everyone played this game on the phone, I transferred it to the PC.

To run, you need to install Python and the Pygame module in it.

The goal of the game:

Score as many points as possible by eating the food.

With each point scored, the speed of the snake increases.

If the snake goes beyond the boundaries of the playing field, then you have lost.

If the snake crashed into its tail, then you lost.

Controlling:

Move the snake with the arrow keys on the keyboard.

If you lose, the C key is to start over, and the Q key is to exit the game.
